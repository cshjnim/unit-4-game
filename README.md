# unit-4-game & JQuery

1. Need to use Jquery library to create a new interactive game for web browsers.

2. Create a new GitHub repo called 'unit-4-game', then clone it to computer. 

3. Create an index.html file, and create a assets directory. 

4. Inside of the 'assets' directory, make three additional folders: javascript, css, and images.

5. In the 'javascript' folder, make a filed called 'game.js', in the 'css' folder, make a file called 'style.css' and 'reset.css'. 

6. Make a CrystalsCollector Game.

7. Here's how the app works:

   * There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

   * The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

   * When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

     * Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
     * When they do click one, update the player's score counter.

   * The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

   * The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

   * The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

     * When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

   * The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.

##### Option 1 Game design notes

* The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120.

* Each crystal should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
